Designed and developed a personal portfolio website to showcase my projects, skills, and professional experience. The website features a clean and modern interface with sections for About Me, Skills, Projects, Work Experience, and Contact, providing a seamless user experience. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across devices and screen sizes. Implemented smooth scrolling, interactive project cards, and a contact form to enhance user engagement. The website serves as a professional online presence and a platform to demonstrate my technical skills and creativity.
